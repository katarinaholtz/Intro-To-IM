# FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL: Corona Clean-Up 

This would expand on [my Processing game](https://github.com/katarinaholtz/Intro-To-IM/tree/master/April7) inspired by *Club Penguin*'s [Puffle Round-Up Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CJY_f6Bb98). 

Instead of rounding up balls or puffles, however, the player would be rounding up 'Coronavirus' to put into the hand sanitizer/disenfectant box that would eliminate them. 


## Updates and Ideas

### Instructions and Game Over

The game should start with an instructions screen with a "Play Now" button that actually starts the game. I also want there to be a 'Game Over' end screen. As of right now, I think the game will only end if the player succeeds, but depending how difficult it is, I may actually try and have them beat a clock or infection rate?

### Sound

I want there to be music playing during the game and sound or a ding each time a virus gets 'deleted'.

### Visuals

I want to build on the visuals of the game so the 'ball class' looks more like a virus and the box can resemble something that would disinfect or eradicate it.

### Progress Bar

On the side of the game, I want there to be a progress bar of how many viruses have been eradicated.


### Dream Goal

Some kind of way to have there be an infection rate/death rate that the player is playing against. For example, a second class of people walking through the screen that the balls would hit, and if a certain number of those are hit, the infection rate is too high.
