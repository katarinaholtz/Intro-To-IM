**REASSURING MESSAGE CHATTER BOX**

March is Mental Health Awareness Month! Life can get tough sometimes and we could use a reassuring message or good thought to keep us going. 

The *Reassuring Message Chatter Box* is a spin on the traditional fortune teller chatter box of our elementary school years. This one interacts with an LCD screen that prompts users to start by rating their day on a scale of 1-10, and then choosing a mood. When the user flips open the paper flap, instead of a fortune, there will be a prompt to 'press here' and then a reassuring message appears on the screen, along with a little jingle.

*The 'bored' sensor was still not properly mapped, which is why the melody appears.*
