## Coding Process

Using nested for loops greatly simplified the code because it allowed for a loop which created the nested squares, repeated it across a row, and repeated the row four more times to fill up the screen. Certain elements of creating the boxes were random, as in the original piece, such as the number (iterations) of nested squares, the offset between them, and the color.
