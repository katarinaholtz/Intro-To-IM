The goal of this circuit is to turn on all the lights - but there are steps to figure out how to do so. 

First, use the light meter to see what color button(s) you must press to turn on some of the lights. Then, use the sliding switch to turn on the last light(s).

I had a lot of problems with making the red and blue LEDs turn on brightly when the light sensor was in use. Even though it worked in my first test, the more I added to the code, it seemed to dim (even though having it just turn on one or the other didn't seem to change the brightness, in case it was an issue of power being split?)

I wanted to use a sliding switch at first, but it never worked. It stayed on HIGH at all times, making it impossible to use it to control the last, green LED.
